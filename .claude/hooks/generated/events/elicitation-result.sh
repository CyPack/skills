# Event:
#   ElicitationResult
#
# What this event is for:
#   Runs after a user responds to an MCP elicitation, before the response is sent back.
#
# Why this stub exists:
#   This scaffold creates one script per official Claude Code hook event so the
#   target project has a stable place to add logic later. Leaving the stub in
#   place makes future additive refreshes and event-set updates predictable.
#
# Recommended starting style:
#   Keep sync because the hook can rewrite or block the elicitation response.

# Event:
#   PostCompact
#
# What this event is for:
#   Runs after context compaction completes.
#
# Why this stub exists:
#   This scaffold creates one script per official Claude Code hook event so the
#   target project has a stable place to add logic later. Leaving the stub in
#   place makes future additive refreshes and event-set updates predictable.
#
# Recommended starting style:
#   Use async for passive logging. Keep sync only when the follow-up state must be ready immediately.

# This default scaffold does nothing yet.

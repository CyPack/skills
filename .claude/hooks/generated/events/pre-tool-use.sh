# Event:
#   PreToolUse
#
# What this event is for:
#   Runs before a tool call executes and can block it.
#
# Why this stub exists:
#   This scaffold creates one script per official Claude Code hook event so the
#   target project has a stable place to add logic later. Leaving the stub in
#   place makes future additive refreshes and event-set updates predictable.
#
# Recommended starting style:
#   Keep sync for safety or policy gates. Async is not useful when you need to block.

# This default scaffold does nothing yet.
